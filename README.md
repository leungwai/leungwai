# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Leung Wai!

I am a software engineer and technology enthusiast. I enjoy coding, creating apps that optimizes people's daily lives, as well as optimizng and debugging code to make it look and run nice. I enjoy tinkering with hardware and software, tweaking and optimizing them to make it run to its fullest potential. I also love keeping up with the latest technology, especially smartphones, and PCs. As a recent undergraduate of Washington University in St. Louis, I hope to land a role in software engineering so that I can continue my passion of software engineering in a professional environment. 

## A little bit more about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **my personal website** _(coming soon!)_
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refreshing on my **HTML/CSS/JS skills**
- âš¡ Fun facts:
  - I love trains ðŸš‚!
  - My main laptop for 3 years was a $25 2012 MacBook Pro that I refurbished from the ground up
